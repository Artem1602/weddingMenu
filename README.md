# WeddingMenu Project

The **WeddingMenu** project is a web-based system designed to display, manage, and organize wedding menu information in a structured and visually clear way.  
It focuses on **simplicity, clarity, and easy customization** rather than complex data structures.

### Key Concepts
- **JSON-driven structure:** All menu data (groups, items, prices, and weights) are defined in a simple JSON format.
- **Angular frontend:** The application is built with Angular, providing modular components and modern UI patterns.
- **Minimal data preprocessing:** Price and weight values are stored and displayed as plain strings, avoiding unnecessary parsing complexity.
- **Group-based organization:** Menu items are grouped logically (e.g., appetizers, main dishes, drinks) for easy navigation.

### Purpose
This project aims to provide a lightweight, maintainable solution for displaying and editing wedding menus without relying on heavy backend logic or external databases.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Angular 17+
- **Language:** TypeScript, HTML, SCSS
- **Data Format:** JSON files grouped by category

### Project Goals
- Simplify menu management.
- Enable quick customization of dishes, prices, and weights.
- Allow seamless integration with visual web components.
